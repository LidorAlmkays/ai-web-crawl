# PRD-9: Distributed Tracing Implementation

## Overview

This directory contains the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for implementing distributed tracing capabilities in the task-manager service. The implementation extends the existing observability stack to include comprehensive trace collection and visualization.

## Key Documents

- **[PRD-9-DISTRIBUTED-TRACING.md](./PRD-9-DISTRIBUTED-TRACING.md)** - Complete PRD with detailed implementation plan

## Implementation Summary

### What We're Adding

1. **Core Tracing Infrastructure**

   - Trace manager for centralized span management
   - Trace context propagation utilities
   - Standardized trace attributes
   - Express middleware for HTTP request tracing

2. **Business Logic Instrumentation**

   - Task manager service tracing
   - Kafka message processing tracing
   - Database operation tracing
   - Performance monitoring integration

3. **Configuration and Integration**
   - Enhanced OpenTelemetry configuration
   - Tracing configuration management
   - Environment variable setup
   - Integration with existing observability stack

### Architecture Flow

```
Task-Manager Service
├── Auto-instrumentation (HTTP, DB, Kafka)
├── Manual instrumentation (Business logic)
├── Trace context propagation
└── OTEL SDK → OTEL Collector → Tempo → Grafana
```

### Key Benefits

- **Performance Visibility**: Track end-to-end request flows
- **Debugging Efficiency**: 50% reduction in debugging time
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Faster issue identification and resolution
- **Business Metrics**: Correlate technical traces with business operations
- **Scalability**: Handle high-volume trace collection efficiently

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Core Infrastructure
2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: Business Logic Instrumentation
3. **Phase 3 (Week 5)**: Testing and Validation
4. **Phase 4 (Week 6)**: Deployment and Monitoring

### Success Metrics

- **Technical**: >95% trace coverage, <1ms overhead, >99% export success
- **Business**: <5min MTTD, <30min MTTR, >99.9% availability
- **Developer**: 50% reduction in debugging time

### Dependencies

All required OpenTelemetry packages are already installed:

- `@opentelemetry/api`
- `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`
- `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`
- `@opentelemetry/resources`
- `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`

### Current State

✅ **Already Available:**

- OpenTelemetry SDK configured
- OTEL Collector with traces pipeline to Tempo
- Tempo and Grafana deployed
- Logging system with OTEL integration
- Metrics collection via Prometheus
- Auto-instrumentation enabled

❌ **Missing (To Be Implemented):**

- Manual trace instrumentation for business logic
- Custom span creation for key operations
- Trace context propagation across service boundaries
- Structured trace attributes for business context
- Performance monitoring integration

### Next Steps

1. Review and approve the PRD
2. Break down implementation into detailed tasks
3. Assign resources to specific components
4. Begin phased implementation
5. Comprehensive testing at each phase
6. Gradual production rollout
