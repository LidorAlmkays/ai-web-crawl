# Job J14: Deduplicate Success Logging (Single-Source-of-Truth)

Status: ✅ Completed
Priority: Medium
Dependencies: J11 (Logging Policy Overhaul)
ETA: 0.5-1 hour

## Summary
Eliminate duplicated success logs across infra → app → api layers. Maintain a single source of truth:
- Prefer span attributes/events for successful operations; no multi-layer success logs.
- Keep at most one debug success message at the boundary (handler) when valuable.

## Scope & Changes
- Infrastructure: remove success prints (DB save/update success).
- Application services: remove success prints, rely on spans.
- Handlers/API: optional debug success (one line) or none.

## Verification
- Send a NEW task; verify console shows only request-in and no success spam.

## Checklist
- [ ] Remove infra success logs
- [ ] Remove app success logs
- [ ] Optional boundary debug success
