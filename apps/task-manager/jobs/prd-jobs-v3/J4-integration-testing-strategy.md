**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Complete message flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Errors are properly handled and logged
- [ ] System recovers gracefully from failures
- [ ] Data consistency is maintained
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

### J4.5: Observability Stack Integration Testing

**Objective**: Test OpenTelemetry integration and monitoring capabilities.

**Test Scenarios**:

- OTEL initialization and configuration
- Trace propagation across components
- Metrics collection and reporting
- Log correlation with traces
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring dashboard integration

**Files to Create**:

- `src/common/utils/__tests__/otel-integration.spec.ts`
- `src/common/utils/__tests__/monitoring-integration.spec.ts`

- [ ] Logs are correlated with traces
- [ ] Health checks return proper status

## Test Infrastructure Setup

### Test Database

- Use Docker container for PostgreSQL test instance
- Separate test database with isolated schema
- Automated setup and teardown scripts
- Test data seeding and cleanup

### Test Kafka Cluster

- Use Docker container for Kafka test instance
- Separate test topics with isolated data
- Automated topic creation and cleanup
- Test message production and consumption

### Test Environment

- Isolated environment variables for testing
- Separate log files for test runs
