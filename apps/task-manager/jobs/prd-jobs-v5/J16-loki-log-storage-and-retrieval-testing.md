### Integration Options for Complete Pipeline

**Option 1: Custom OTEL Exporter**

- Create a custom Loki exporter for OTEL Collector
- Requires development of custom exporter component

**Option 2: Log Forwarder Service**

- Create a service that reads OTEL Collector debug output
- Forwards logs to Loki via HTTP API

**Option 3: Use OTEL Collector Contrib**

- Switch to `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` image
- Includes built-in Loki exporter

## Next Steps

After completing Job 16, proceed to:

- **Job 17**: End-to-End Log Flow Integration Testing (with complete pipeline)

## Estimated Time

**✅ COMPLETED** - Loki log storage and retrieval testing (0.5 days)
