## OTEL Collector Log Verification ✅

**Sample log received and processed by OTEL Collector:**

```
Resource attributes:
     -> 0: Map({"key":"service.name","value":{"stringValue":"Task Manager"}})
     -> service.name: Str(task-manager)
ScopeLogs #0
LogRecord #0
ObservedTimestamp: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
Timestamp: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
SeverityText: INFO
SeverityNumber: Info(9)
Body: Map({"stringValue":"Test message with metadata"})
Attributes:
     -> 0: Map({"key":"correlationId","value":{"stringValue":"test-123"}})
     -> 1: Map({"key":"taskId","value":{"stringValue":"task-456"}})
     -> 2: Map({"key":"userEmail","value":{"stringValue":"test@example.com"}})
```
