## How to Use These Jobs

### 1. Sequential Implementation
Jobs are designed to be implemented in order. Each job builds upon the previous ones:

```bash
# Start with Job 1
# Complete all testing criteria before moving to Job 2
# Continue sequentially through all jobs
```

### 2. Testing at Each Step
Each job includes comprehensive testing criteria. Complete all tests before proceeding:

```bash
# For each job:
# 1. Implement the code
# 2. Run the tests
# 3. Verify all testing criteria
# 4. Document any issues
# 5. Move to next job
```

### 3. Validation Checklist
Use the testing criteria in each job as a checklist:

- [ ] All files created correctly
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Documentation complete

### 4. Rollback Planning
Each job includes a rollback plan. If a job fails:

1. Follow the rollback plan
2. Document what failed
3. Create an issue for investigation
4. Fix the issue before proceeding

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All jobs completed successfully
- [ ] 100% test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] Sub-100ms response times
- [ ] Zero memory leaks
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Clean architecture principles followed
- [ ] Code is maintainable and readable
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] No technical debt introduced

### Operational Metrics
- [ ] Service starts without errors
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Kafka messages are published
- [ ] Traces are generated and exported
- [ ] Metrics are collected

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Kafka connectivity issues**: Implement retry logic and circuit breakers
- **OpenTelemetry setup problems**: Use proven patterns from task-manager
- **DTO validation failures**: Comprehensive testing and error handling

### Timeline Risks
- **Job dependencies**: Clear prerequisite tracking
- **Integration complexity**: Incremental testing at each job
- **Knowledge transfer**: Document decisions and patterns

### Quality Risks
- **Architecture drift**: Regular reviews against PRD
- **Testing gaps**: Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- **Performance issues**: Early performance testing

## Getting Started

1. **Review the PRD**: Understand the overall requirements
2. **Set up environment**: Ensure all prerequisites are met
3. **Start with Job 1**: Begin with project structure setup
4. **Follow the process**: Implement each job sequentially
5. **Test thoroughly**: Complete all testing criteria
6. **Document progress**: Keep track of implementation status

## Support and Questions

If you encounter issues during implementation:

1. **Check the job documentation**: Each job includes troubleshooting sections
2. **Review prerequisites**: Ensure all dependencies are met
3. **Check the rollback plan**: Follow the rollback procedure if needed
4. **Create an issue**: Document the problem for investigation

## Completion Checklist

Before considering the refactor complete:

- [ ] All 14 jobs implemented successfully
- [ ] All testing criteria met
- [ ] Performance requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No critical issues outstanding
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Deployment tested

This job breakdown ensures that each piece can be implemented, tested, and validated independently, making the overall refactor much more manageable and reducing risk.
