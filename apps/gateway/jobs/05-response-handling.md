# Job 5 (New): Crawl Response Logic

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Objective

Create and **test** the application and API components for processing completed crawl jobs.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Create Application Port

- **File**: `apps/gateway/src/application/ports/process-crawl-response.port.ts`

### 2. Create and Test Application Service

- **File**: `apps/gateway/src/application/services/process-crawl-response.service.ts`
- **Test File**: `apps/gateway/src/application/services/process-crawl-response.service.spec.ts`
  - **Unit Test**:
    - **Setup**: Mock `ICrawlStateRepositoryPort` and `IUserNotificationPort`.
    - **Action**: Call `ProcessCrawlResponseService.execute()`.
    - **Assert**: Verify `crawlStateRepository.findByHash` is called.
    - **Assert**: Verify `userNotification.send` is called with the correct connection ID and result.
    - **Assert**: Verify `crawlStateRepository.delete` is called.
    - **Edge Case**: Test what happens if `findByHash` returns `null`. Assert that `send` and `delete` are **not** called.

### 3. Create API Consumer (Implementation Only)

- **File**: `apps/gateway/src/api/kafka/crawl-response.consumer.ts`
  - **Note**: The consumer itself is difficult to unit test. Its logic will be validated via the final E2E test.

## Verification

- All implementation and test files are created.
- All unit tests pass (`npx nx test gateway`).
- The project builds successfully (`npx nx build gateway`).
